# Hopped jQuery Call

If you want to use the hops JSON as if it were an API in your project, you need only use the jQuery `getJSON` method as follows:

```

      const url = 'https://jackdixonryan.github.io/Hopped/hops.JSON'
      
      $.getJSON(url).done(function(data){
          console.log(data);
          
```

# Hopped
Custom-built JSON files for homebrewers to find the appropriate hops.

For now, Hopped will only be a JSON file so that I can experiment with data that I built myself. In the future, I hope to see how it develops.
